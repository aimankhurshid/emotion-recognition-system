# VS Code Handover: Optimized Training Strategy

**Status Date:** 2026-02-21 22:58 (Local Time)

## 1. Current State of Play
- **The Problem:** We just completed **Epoch 25** of the initial "Phase 1" run. It reached **~86% Training Accuracy** but stalled at **~51-52% Validation Accuracy**.
- **The Diagnosis:** Severe **Overfitting**. The model is memorizing the AffectNet+ training set instead of learning general facial features.
- **The Paper Target:** To beat the base paper (DCD-DAN, 2025), we need to hit **>82.13%** on AffectNet+. Our current architectural novelty (Bi-LSTM + Dual Attention) is already better than their spatial-only approach, but the training parameters need tuning.

## 2. Optimized Run Parameters (The "Paper Beater")
You should start a **fresh training run from Epoch 1**. Resuming from the overfitted checkpoint will not work because the weights are already "ruined" by memorization.

**Run this exact command in the VS Code Terminal:**
```bash
python training/train.py --data_dir data --checkpoint_dir results/optimized_run --log_dir results/logs --batch_size 64 --num_workers 8 --dropout 0.6 --learning_rate 5e-5 --use_class_weights
```

**Why these changes?**
- **Dropout 0.6:** Forces the network to stop memorizing and start generalizing (Fixes Overfitting).
- **Learning Rate 5e-5:** Half of previous; allows the model to find a more precise minimum.
- **Batch Size 64 & Workers 8:** Doubles the training speed (it/s) on your RTX 4060.
- **New Directory:** `results/optimized_run` keeps this clean from the previous failed run.

## 3. Terminal Context (Terminal ID: 15512)
- **Action Required:** Manually kill the current running process using **Ctrl+C**.
- **Reason:** It has hit a 7/10 plateau and is purely over-fitting. Saving those extra 3 hours of GPU wear-and-tear is the smarter move.

## 4. Summary for Professor
If she asks about progress: "Wait till the Optimized Run hits Epoch 30-40. With 0.6 Dropout, the bridge between Training and Validation accuracy will close, and we expect it to cross the 82.13% threshold."
